# Sigma2MITRE #

## Description ##
The goal of this project is to provide MITRE mappings for the latest Sigma rules found in the SigmaHQ repository.
From this, it aims to provide an insight into the current coverage for the Sigma ruleset and areas where it can be improved over time with the help of the community.
Any of these mappings can be imported into the [MITRE Navigator](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/) for viewing and exporting into a XLSX or CSV format

### Heatmaps Available: ###
- 1x Mapping for the Windows subfolder under the "Rules" directory
- 1x Mapping for the entire "Rules" directory inclusive of all operating systems
